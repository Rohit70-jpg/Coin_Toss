# Coin_Toss
The Coin Toss Game is a simple web-based game that simulates flipping a coin. When the player clicks the "Toss Coin" button, the program randomly chooses between Heads or Tails and displays the result with a coin image. Each outcome updates the score, keeping track of how many times Heads and Tails have appeared.
